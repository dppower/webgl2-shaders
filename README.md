A collection of shaders for webgl 2, featuring physically based rendering,  
a realistic skybox using inscattering and transmittance. 
  
The project is a VC++ solution, with .vs.glsl and .fs.glsl files treated as  
c++ files (Options > Text Editor > File Extension > Add "glsl" Microsoft Visual C++).  
There is headers that define glsl functions as if they were C++, so end up with a  
crude syntax highlighting for glsl in visual studio.
